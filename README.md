## TDD is Dead, Long Live TyDD!

These are the slides from my talk at the first meetup of our [Young Haskell Padawans](www.meetup.com/young-haskell-padawans/events/200460782/) group. The talk was not recorded.

I have added a few more slides for the benefit of those who were not able to attend the meetup.

The `.key` file has presenter notes, but the `.pdf` doesn't. I didn't imagine Keynote's export would suck so much.
